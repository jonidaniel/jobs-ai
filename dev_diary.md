### 2025/11/26

- Refined reporter agent, now it builds honed cover letter writing instructions for generator agent

- Built the project UI up until the point where a clean result object is retrieved after submit button click

### 2025/11/27

- Made the frontend concise and intuitive
- Implemented a FastAPI HTTP server
- Integrated frontend to backend server, now when frontend submit button is clicked, request travels to FastAPI server, server initiates backend agent logic, then response is sent back to frontend

- Refined the UI so that a more higher quality and more appropriate JSON string is sent to the backend
- Made the backend pipeline return a real Document object (.docx) back to Fast API server
- Made the server endpoint respond to frontend with a Response object (.docx), now everything starting from doing selections and clicking 'submit' in the UI and ending to the browser receiving a pre-written and downloadable Word document cover letter works fast and pretty accurately
