      <h2>What it is?</h2>
      <p>
        An agentic AI system that's designed to automate most of one's job
        searching efforts by finding and evaluating relevant job listings from
        the web and ultimately generating résumés and cover letters for them,
        based on the user's <i>skill profile</i>.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Consists of 7 separate phases following a
        <i>prompt chaining architecture</i>, some of them leveraging LLMs, some
        being deterministic:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>Planner Agent</li>
        <li>Assessor Agent</li>
        <li>Searcher Agent</li>
        <li>Scorer Agent</li>
        <li>Reporter Agent</li>
        <li>Generator Agent</li>
        <li>Notifier Agent</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        Based on the user's initial skillsets and experiences input, creates a
        skill profile of the user, which is used to scrape relevant job listings
        off popular job boards in the web. The listings are then scored and
        organized, and an analysis is made of the whole process thus far. Then,
        tailored résumé and cover letter suggestions are drafted for the
        candidate to use in applying for the jobs. Finally, the analysis and the
        documents are sent to the user's email, if required in the settings. The
        whole workflow is carried out from start to finish with only a single
        user text input, which shows that automation is really in the heart of
        JobsAI.

      <p>
        Leverages today's most sophisticated agentic AI frameworks like OpenAI
        Agents SDK and LangChain. All LLM interactions are fine-tuned for
        highest-quality outcomes. Acts as a clear demonstration of my ability to
        design and implement complete end-to-end agentic systems that automate
        otherwise laborious processes and finally deliver end results that are
        of real value.
