# ---------- GENERATOR AGENT ----------

# ✔ Accepts both the merged SkillProfile and the report text
# ✔ Calls the LLM to produce a tailored job-application email, cover letter, or motivation letter
# ✔ Can be later extended to generate CV sections, project summaries, etc.
# ✔ Uses the same internal structure and design conventions as your other agents
# ✔ Returns the generated text to main.py, where NotifierAgent or others can use it
