"""
Scorer Service - Job Listing Scoring and Matching.

This module contains the ScorerService class, which scores job listings based
on how well they match the candidate's technology stack. The service computes
relevancy scores (0-100%) by comparing job descriptions against the candidate's
skills and experience.

The scoring process:
1. Flattens the candidate's tech stack into a list of technology names
2. Matches technologies found in job descriptions
3. Calculates match percentage based on matched vs. total technologies
4. Enriches job listings with scores, matched skills, and missing skills

    Computes relevancy scores for job listings by matching the candidate's

    - Score (0-100 integer percentage)
