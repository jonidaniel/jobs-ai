"""
Searcher Service - Job Board Scraping and Search.

This module contains the SearcherService class, which searches multiple job
boards for relevant job listings based on candidate-generated keywords. The
service supports multiple job boards (Duunitori, Jobly) and can operate in
"deep mode" to fetch full job descriptions.

The service:
1. Searches each job board with each keyword query
2. Saves raw job listings to disk for debugging
3. Deduplicates jobs across queries and boards (by URL)
4. Returns a consolidated list of unique job listings

    Searches multiple job boards using candidate-generated keywords to find

    - Multi-board searching (Duunitori, Jobly, and extensible to others)
    - Multiple keyword queries per board
    - Deduplication of jobs across queries and boards
    - Persistence of raw job listings for debugging
