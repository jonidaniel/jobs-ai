"""
Query Builder Agent - Search Keyword Generation.

This module contains the QueryBuilderAgent class, which generates job search
keywords from candidate profiles. The agent uses an LLM to analyze the profile
and create a set of optimized search queries that will be used to find relevant
job listings on job boards.

The generated keywords are typically two-word phrases (e.g., "ai engineer",
"software engineer") that are tailored to the candidate's skills and experience.
