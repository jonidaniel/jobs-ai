Profiler Agent - Candidate Profile Generation.

This module contains the ProfilerAgent class, which uses an LLM to extract and
structure candidate skills and experience from form submissions. The agent
transforms raw form data into a comprehensive text profile that describes the
candidate's skills, strengths, and job preferences.

The profile is used throughout the pipeline for:
- Generating search keywords
- Matching jobs to candidate skills
- Writing personalized cover letters
