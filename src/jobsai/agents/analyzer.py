"""
Analyzer Agent - Job Analysis and Cover Letter Instruction Generation.

This module contains the AnalyzerAgent class, which analyzes top-scoring job
listings and generates personalized cover letter instructions for each position.
The agent uses an LLM to analyze job descriptions against candidate profiles
and create specific instructions for writing tailored cover letters.

The analysis includes:
- Job details (title, company, location, score)
- Matched and missing skills
- Personalized cover letter writing instructions
