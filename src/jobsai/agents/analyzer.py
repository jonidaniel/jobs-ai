        Write an analysis on the most-scored jobs.

        For each top-scoring job, the function:
        1. Uses an LLM to generate personalized cover letter instructions
        2. Formats the job details (title, company, location, score, etc.)
        3. Combines everything into a readable report

        The analysis is saved to /data/job_analyses/ and returned.

            profile (str): The candidate profile text.
            analysis_size (int): The desired number of top jobs to include in the analysis.
