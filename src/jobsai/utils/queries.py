"""
Deterministic Query Builder Utilities.

This module provides utilities for generating job search queries from skill
profiles. The query generation is deterministic (same input = same output)
to ensure consistent search results across pipeline runs.

The query builder creates search queries tailored to the candidate's skills,
including variations for different experience levels and specializations.

def build_queries(skill_profile: dict) -> list[str]:
    """
    Build deterministic job search queries from a structured skill profile.

    This function generates search queries that will be used to scrape job boards.
    The queries are built deterministically from the skill profile to ensure
    consistent results across runs.

    Query generation strategy:
    - Core languages: Generate "{lang} developer", "junior {lang} developer", "{lang} engineer"
    - Agentic AI tools: Generate tool name and "{tool} developer"
    - AI/ML experience: Generate general AI/ML job queries
    - Fallback queries: Always include general entry-level queries
    - Specialized queries: Always include LLM and agentic AI queries

    Args:
        skill_profile (dict): A candidate's skill profile dictionary containing:
            - "core_languages": List of programming languages
            - "agentic_ai_experience": List of agentic AI tools/technologies
            - "ai_ml_experience": List of AI/ML technologies
            - Other fields are not used for query generation

    Returns:
        list[str]: A sorted list of unique search query strings
