Form Data Extraction and Transformation Utilities.

This module provides utilities for extracting and transforming frontend form
submission data into a structured format suitable for the JobsAI pipeline.

The main function, extract_form_data(), processes the complex nested structure
from the frontend and extracts:
- Job board selections and deep mode setting
- Cover letter generation preferences (number and style)
- Technology stack organized by category
- Data type conversions and validations

    Extract and transform form submission data into structured format.

    Processes the frontend payload to extract:
    - The selected job boards and deep mode setting
    - The number of cover letters to generate
    - The style of the cover letters
    - Converts and validates data types (e.g., cover_letter_num to int)
    - Handles array-to-string conversion for cover_letter_style

    Args:
        form_submissions (Dict): Form data from frontend containing:
            - "general": Array of 5 single-key objects with general questions (job level, job boards, deep mode, cover letter num, cover letter style)
            - "languages": Array of technology set items with programming, scripting, and markup languages
            - "databases": Array of technology set items with databases
            - "cloud-development": Array of technology set items with cloud development tools
            - "web-frameworks": Array of technology set items with web frameworks and technologies
            - "dev-ides": Array of technology set items with development IDEs
            - "llms": Array of technology set items with LLMs
            - "doc-and-collab": Array of technology set items with document and collaboration tools
            - "operating-systems": Array of technology set items with computer operating systems
            - "additional-info": Array with personal description

    Returns:
        Dict: Structured dictionary with keys:
            - "job_boards": List of selected job boards
            - "deep_mode": String ("Yes" or "No")
            - "cover_letter_num": Integer (number of cover letters to generate)
            - "cover_letter_style": String (style description, e.g., "Professional and Friendly")

    Raises:
        KeyError: If required form fields are missing
