BACKEND ENTRY POINT

This module launches the backend of JobsAI.
It initializes all agents, loads configuration files, sets up logging, and handles workflow orchestration.

For overall project description, see README.md or docs/README.md.

    Launch the complete JobsAI agent pipeline.

    This is the main orchestration function that runs all agents in sequence:
    1. ProfilerAgent: Creates/updates candidate skill profile from form submissions
    2. SearcherAgent: Scrapes job boards for relevant job listings
    3. ScorerAgent: Scores job listings based on skill profile match
    4. ReporterAgent: Generates analysis report on top-scoring jobs
    5. GeneratorAgent: Creates cover letter document based on report

    Args:
        submits (Dict): Form data from frontend containing:
            - General questions (text fields)
            - Technology experience levels (slider values 0-7)
            - Multiple choice selections (e.g., experience levels)

    Returns:
        Dict: Dictionary containing:
            - "document" (Document): The generated cover letter as a Word document
            - "timestamp" (str): Timestamp used for file naming (format: YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS)
