    Launch the complete JobsAI agent pipeline.

    This is the main orchestration function that runs all agents in sequence:
    1. ProfilerAgent: Creates/updates candidate profile from form submissions
    2. SearcherAgent: Scrapes job boards for relevant job listings
    3. ScorerAgent: Scores job listings based on skill profile match
    4. AnalyzerAgent: Writes an analysis on top-scoring jobs
    5. GeneratorAgent: Creates cover letter document based on the analysis

    Args:
        form_submissions (Dict): Form data from frontend containing:
            - General questions (text fields)
            - Technology experience levels (slider values 0-7)
            - Multiple choice selections (e.g., experience levels)

        Dict: Dictionary containing:
            - "document" (Document): The generated cover letter as a Word document
            - "timestamp" (str): Timestamp used for file naming (format: YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS)
