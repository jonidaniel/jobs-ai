"""
JobsAI Backend Pipeline Orchestration.

This module serves as the main entry point for the JobsAI backend pipeline.
It orchestrates the complete workflow from form submissions to cover letter generation:

1. ProfilerAgent: Creates candidate profile from form submissions
2. QueryBuilderAgent: Generates search keywords from profile
3. SearcherService: Searches job boards for relevant positions
4. ScorerService: Scores jobs based on candidate profile match
5. AnalyzerAgent: Analyzes top-scoring jobs and generates cover letter instructions
6. GeneratorAgent: Generates personalized cover letter document

The pipeline uses a decorator-based approach for consistent error handling and logging
across all steps.

For overall project description, see README.md or docs/README.md.
